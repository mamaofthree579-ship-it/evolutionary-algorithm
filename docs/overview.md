# Evolutionary & Symbolic Ecosystem Simulation — Project Overview

## Purpose
To simulate and analyze the parallel evolutionary trajectories of symbolic and biological intelligence — focusing on four core archetypes:
- **Naga Lineage:** Semi-aquatic, hydro-symbolic engineers.
- **Ant People Lineage:** Subterranean, eusocial architects with distributed intelligence.
- **Winged People Lineage:** Aerial harmonizers integrating biological flight and reflective symbol technology.
- **Arboreal Network Lineage:** Plant-based collective intelligence using bioelectric and chemical communication.

## Objectives
1. **Evolutionary Modeling:** Explore adaptive dynamics under varied environmental and energetic constraints.
2. **Symbolic Correlation:** Identify shared symbolic “languages” across species used for structural, energetic, or social communication.
3. **Hydrostructural Systems:** Model structured-water technologies and their effects on stability and energy distribution.
4. **Cross-Species Interaction:** Examine cooperative, competitive, and hybridization events among lineages.
5. **Energetic Resonance Mapping:** Simulate light-frequency and vibrational coupling across species systems.

## Approach
- Use **agent-based simulation** (Mesa framework) for interspecies interaction modeling.
- Apply **evolutionary algorithms (DEAP)** to evolve species’ traits and symbolic repertoires.
- Represent **environmental topographies** via geospatial data models.
- Conduct **symbolic correlation** via network analysis and geometric mapping.
- Integrate **structured-water dynamics** using simplified fluid models.

## Outputs
- Multi-species co-evolution simulations
- Symbolic correlation maps
- Energy resonance distribution visualizations
- Periodic summary reports & key evolutionary insights
