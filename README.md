# Evolutionary Algorithm for Parallel Speculative Biology

An open-source project exploring adaptive, parallel evolutionary models to simulate the co-development of multiple intelligent species (e.g., aquatic, aerial, and subterranean civilizations) and environmental systems.

## 🌍 Goals
- Simulate co-evolution across environmental and symbolic systems.
- Explore emergent intelligence patterns.
- Develop open frameworks for parallel adaptive computation.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
- Parallel species evolution
- Environmental feedback systems
- Symbolic interaction networks
- Hydrodynamic and atmospheric modeling

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evolutionary-algorithm.git
cd evolutionary-algorithm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
